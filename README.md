## Features

- Resolve domain names to IP addresses.
- Perform reverse DNS lookups.
- Support for multiple domain queries.
- Output results in JSON format for easy integration.
- Logging feature to save lookup history.

## Installation

  ```
- Query multiple domains:
  ```bash
  python dns_lookup.py --domain example.com google.com
  ```
- Save results to a log file:
  ```bash
  python dns_lookup.py --log
  ```
- Output results in JSON format:
  ```bash
  python dns_lookup.py --json
  ```

## Example Output

```bash
Domain: example.com
Resolved IP: 93.184.216.34

IP Address: 8.8.8.8
